The [Canadian Digital Service](https://digital.canada.ca) (CDS) partnered with Public Services and Procurement Canada (PSPC) to conduct Discovery research over a period of twelve weeks from May to August, 2019. 

The goal was to explore the feasibility of building a single point of access website that would contain procurement opportunities from all levels of the Canadian public sector, including federal, territorial, provincial and municipal governments, as well as publicly-funded academic, social and health services institutions. This single point of access is a requirement by the Comprehensive Economic Trade Agreement (CETA) with the European Union, to be in place by September 2022.

These pages contain the results of our findings and considerations for moving forward. Much of our research could be used by any or all public sector organizations to make it easier for businesses to find relevant contract opportunities.
